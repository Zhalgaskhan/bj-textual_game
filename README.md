# bj-textual_game

Here I am implementing Black Jack card game logic and playing algorithm in python.
Firstly I am trying to make game for 2 players, later I will try to add some logic to Computer(kind a AI/ML) to make it smarter if it's possible))

Code is written on python, using some basic OOP architecture like Encapulation. Also I use json file to store some relevant info
